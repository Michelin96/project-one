## Hypothesis

Is there a correlation between investment in an NBA team and performance in the league?

## Questions

* Is there a correlation between the number of highly paid players on a team and their regular season wins?

* Do teams with high paid players impact fan attendance?

* What is the relationship between team valuation and the number of wins by year?

* What are some ways to qualitatively define the relative success of teams?

## Data Analyzed

* Five years of Regular NBA Seasons (2015 - 2019)
* All 30 NBA Teams
* Players with salaries over 20 million
* Data of numbers of wins over five seasons (2015 -2019)

## Wins Analysis

* A barchart of the total wins for each team was plotted to establish a clear comparison of how successful each team has been
over the past 5 years in terms of total wins. This chart revealed a wide range of wins across all 30 teams with the top performing team a full 196 wins ahead of the worst performing team.

* To further understand and quantify success of the teams, a line graph was plotted of the actual wins per season for top 5 performing teams versus the team that represented the Median of all team, and the worst performing team. This chart revealed that the top performing teams, although generally at the top of the graph, at times fell below the team that represented the median performing team. Additionally, in 2015-16 there was broader range of wins among the top 5 teams (~ 35 wins) as compared to the most recent season (~ 10 wins) which was much closer.

* Digging a bit deeper, to understand which teams performed the most consistently, a box-plot of the top 5 teams and the median and worst teams was created.  For the top 5 teams - few outliers were observed, indicating mostly consistent success, the team representing the median of all teams has the largest interquartile range indicating a boad variance in wins across the 5 seasons.  The worst performing shows a single outlier and as a result, a mean value that is greater than the median.

* In order to a get a sense of the range in terms of quartiles, the median, and the mean, of wins data across all teams, a box plot was generated for the wins data for the entire league. Here are the quantitative results:  
        The lower quartile of team wins is: 33.1
        The upper quartile of team wins is: 47.2
        The interquartile range of team wins is: 14.100000000000001
        The median of team wins is: 40.7 
        Values below 11.95 could be outliers.
        Values above 68.35000000000001 could be outliers.

## Attendance Analysis

* A bar chart was used to compare game attendance to teams with high paid players (salary >20 million). For home game attendance, the margin decreased between teams with high paid players and those with out. However, road game attendance showed very little change in margin over the same five year period.

* Using a line graph, the number of teams with high paid players were compared to those with no high paid players. Over the five year time period, the teams with high paid players increased dramitically, which in turn made fewer teams with no high paid players.

* The attendance by team average for all five seassons was analyzed in a box plot. Both home averages have similar inner quartile ranges, but the mean for teams with no high paid players was signicantly lower. Road game analysis showed very narrow quartile ranges. This seems to indicate that fans are less likely to go out of town to see their team play.
