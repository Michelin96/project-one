## Hypothesis

Is there a correlation between investment in an NBA team and their performance in their league?

## Questions

* How is success of a sport team measured?
What is the relationship between investment in a team and the number of wins by year?
* Is there a correlation between the investment and the region in which the teams are in (Eastern Conference vs Western Conference)?
